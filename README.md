The Pewlett-Hackard Company required assistance as they would like to be prepared for a number of their employees getting ready for retirement. PH (Pewlett-Hackard) required a headcount of the number of employees about to retire, the number of positions that need to be filled, and a number of employees that are eligible for mentorship as the retirees will be leaving.
